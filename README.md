# Kuramoto_Simulations

1 dimensional and 2 dimensional simulations of a kuramoto system. The mean field is applied in 
the one dimensional simulation and then adjacent coupling and inverse square coupling is applied
to the the two dimensional simulation.

  note: the runAS() function runs the adjacent coupling and the runIS() function runs the inverse
  square coupling. They basically act the same, inverse square is just more taxing to run.
